Firehose Inventory Management is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app which is focused on firehose management.  I created this application to meet a real world need which was related to me by a local firefighter friend.

## Technologies Used
SpringBoot as my Java MVC
MySQL for my database
Maven for project managment
Angular 6 with bootstrap for the CSS

##### Note: You will need to add the application.properties file to configure the JDBC database for the Springboot api to build and run correctly.
